## Running Repo After Cloning
1. Run `composer install` to generate depedencies in vendor folder.
2. Create <ins>.env<ins> file in the root of the project (next to <ins>.env.example<ins>).
3. Copy all data inside <ins>.env.example<ins> to <ins>.env<ins>.
4. Run `php artisan key:generate` to generate application key.
5. Configure <ins>.env<ins> (see the details below).
6. Make MySql database based on <ins>.env</ins> database name.
7. Run `php artisan migrate:fresh`.
8. Run `php artisan storage:link`.
9. Run the app using using `php artisan serve`

## Configuring .env
Some section of the environment variables might be generated by default, but, there are still some extra variables that you should add in order for the application to work. You will have to add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to the environment file since we will require that for our login from Google function.
- First thing first, you will have to make a project in Google Cloud. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- After that, you can go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials and you need to make **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**. (you will also wanna make sure to authorize `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/callback` in the credential redirect URI authorization). 
- After finished making OAuth 2.0 Client ID, you can now download your OAuth credentials and put it inside your .env file.
